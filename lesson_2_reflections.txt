What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Answer: Git init is used to start using git on a project thatâ€™s not under git yet. When you git init, you link git with certain files so you can create and communicate more efficiently and effectively with projects.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Answer: The staging area contains the file or (logically-related) files that are ready to be committed (for tracking) to the git repository.  The working directory contains all the files -- those about to be committed and those that are not yet  ready for committing to the repository of the project.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

Answer: Use the staging area for staging files that are inter-related with respect to the single feature that has been added or single bug that has been fixed. The staging area is a monitored area by git. It is not required to contain all files from the working directory. The files are not yet in the repository so you can still add/remove files from the staging area before making a commit.
