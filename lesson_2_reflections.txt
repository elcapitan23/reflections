What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Answer: Git init is used to start using git on a project thatâ€™s not under git yet. When you git init, you link git with certain files so you can create and communicate more efficiently and effectively with projects.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Answer: The staging area contains the file or (logically-related) files that are ready to be committed (for tracking) to the git repository.  The working directory contains all the files -- those about to be committed and those that are not yet  ready for committing to the repository of the project.
